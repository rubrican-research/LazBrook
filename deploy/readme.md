# Files for deployment
These files need to be in the same folder as your program. [Brook Framework](https://risoflora.github.io/brookframework/) needs the [libsagui library](https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui)

**libsagui**: (https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui/releases/tag/v3.5.2). Deploy appropriate libsagui binary with your application.
**mimes.types** is needed to determine the mime-type of file before serving it through the browser.
